# aws-code-whisperer.vim

> VIM plugin for AWS CodeWhisperer.

## Motivation

There is no VIM/neovim plugin for CodeWhisperer. I don't like VSCode so I decided to make my own plugin.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Reverse engineering of AWS Toolkit for VSCode https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-vscode/blob/master/src/codewhisperer
- [ ] Basic functionalities for code complition based on https://github.com/github/copilot.vim
- [ ] solve issue with login/activation
